# World_Weather_Analysis


## Overview
This project was a python script used to create a database of information from OpenWeatherMap to build a database that we could then use in collaboration with Google Places API to add more information to this database. We took the cities and then made another call for information to help populate the database with a nearby hotel to provide the user with a loding option for that specific city. Lastly, we built out an itinerary to simulate taking a roadtrip.

Images have been provided to help illustrate the work.
